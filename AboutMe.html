                        My education has led me on quite the unusual path to where I am today. I was on the fast track for business, ever since the age of 16, when I enrolled in began my associates degree in business. I ended up graduating highschool with the degree and heading
                        off the college to study accounting to continue to refine my business knowledge. I ended up earning a bachelors degree in accounting and my masters degree in finance, both with honors, before my 21st birthday. I felt so ready to
                        finally start my life and career.

                        I was sorely mistaken. The work that I thought I wanted to do this whole time really wasn't a reflection of my interests. I began to study for my CPA to further my career, but quickly
                        found myself enrolling in a coding bootcamp, and then enrolling in an actual bachelors program shortly after. That takes me to today, as I am in the program, trying to change my career to something that interests me, and allows me to think critically on a daily basis.
